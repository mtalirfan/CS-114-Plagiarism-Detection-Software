Your designed program should meet the following conditions and rules.
1) Should take the name of the Test file and 5 source files from the user as input.
2) Match the test file with source files 1 by 1 and keeps a track of the number of words
and phrases/clauses found similar.
3) It should keep track of and print similar words in the following fashion
Total Number of similar words found=143
33 from file 1
10 from file 2
50 from file 3
25 from file 4
25 from file 5
Note: The given word count is only for example, the actual word count will depend
upon the test and source files.
4) Should generate a Similarity index report both at the end of the file and on the console
in the following formatting.
 Similarity Index= __%
Source 1 = __%
Source 2 = __%
Source 3 = __%
Source 4 = __%
Source 5 = __%
Note: Count the number of words that are shared between the test and source files.
Count the total number of words in both files (shared and un-shared). Divide the
number of shared words by the total number of words. Multiply the number you found
by 100.0.
Similarity Index = Number of Shared Words
Total Number of Words in all filesùëã100
Use the same formula to generate a similarity index from every source file i.e. from the
Test file and 5 source files.
