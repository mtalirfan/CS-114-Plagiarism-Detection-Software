A plagiarism detection software is a Software system that takes a submitted text as input, and
compares the text against a set of publicly available and privately held documents, resulting
in a similarity report. The similarity report includes marking of similar or identical text,
hyperlinks or other references to sources that match it, and an overall similarity report. Such
software is developed specifically to identify cases where someone's work is presented
totally or partially without giving credit to its owner and without applying proper citation
practices. The idea behind this project is to develop a simple program that can check
plagiarism of a simple text file by comparing it with 5 different source files.

		Similarity Index = 9.72%
Source 1	= 12.9%
Source 2	= 12.8%
Source 3	= 5.26%
Source 4	= 3.12%
Source 5	= 4.01%
