Considering the above example suppose the test file contains 200 words and total
number of words of 5 source files is 200, 300, 150, 500, and 300 respectively. Then
Similarity index will be calculated as follows:
Total Similarity Index=
Number of Shared Words
Total Number of Words in all files𝑋100

 =
143
200+300+150+500+300+200
𝑋100 =8.6%
From Source 1 =
Number of Shared Words between 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒 𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑒 1
Total Number of Words in test and source file 1
𝑋100

 =
33
200+200
𝑋100 = 8.25%
From Source 2 =
Number of Shared Words between 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒 𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑒 2
Total Number of Words in test and source file 2
𝑋100

 =
10
200+300
𝑋100 = 2%
You can similarly calculate the similarity index from the remaining files too.
5) Total number of phrases found similar.
Then it should print the similar phrases found at the end of the test file as follows:
Total Number of Similar Phrases= 32
 Similar Phrases/Clauses Source File

b) Living in Pakistan 5
c) The amazing Spiderman 3
