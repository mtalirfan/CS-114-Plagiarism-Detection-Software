Plagiarism is copying someone elseâ€™s work and presenting it as your own. It is a case where academics take large portions of text and do not credit or cite original owners, often unknowingly owing to lack of free-of-cost, no-restriction, and comprehensive plagiarism-checking application which they could use hassle-free.
In this document, we propose a solution to combat plagiarism, a software in the programming language C++ (C plus plus). Our developed program works by asking the user for the name of the file for which the plagiarism needs to be checked, which it then compares against a set of source files, taking count of any words, then phrases that are similar in our test file and each of the original source files. Using the data mentioned before, total words in the test file and a similarity index equation, the similarity index is calculated for the test file versus each source file. The program concludes with attaching a similarity report that contains essential data related to plagiarism, at the end of our test file itself.
